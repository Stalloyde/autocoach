As a swim coach, sending swimmers off at each interval is a repetitive but low-value task. Letâ€™s break it down: with 20 swimmers and 4 lanes, each lane has 5 swimmers. Running a workout of 8x50 on a 1:00 interval means calling out 'Ready, Go!' five times per repetition, totaling 40 times for the entire workout.

This app was created to automate that process. By taking care of these repetitive tasks, it allows me to focus on real coaching instead of acting as a glorified traffic light.

Coaches can simply input the workout details and hit start to run the session. Creating an account also enables users to save their favorite workouts for quick access through a "Save as Favorites" feature.
